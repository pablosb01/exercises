      <h1>The Lord of the Rings: Gollum</h1>
      <h3><strong>Worst Game of 2023</strong></h3>
      <p>Also the worst Lord of the Rings game adaptation in history, stealth platformer Gollum attempts to deliver an original story for its title character that is set between the events of The Hobbit and The Fellowship of the Ring. Critics note that extensive knowledge of Tolkien's books is a prerequisite for enjoying the game, but that's just the least of Gollum's problems. "Dull" and "tedious" are words that reviewers have used again and again to describe gameplay, while the controls leave something to be desired. But the biggest flaw is the game's visualsâ€”or maybe it's the many game-breaking bugs. At any rate, it's a complete package: completely terrible.</p>
